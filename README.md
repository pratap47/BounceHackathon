# BounceHackathon
It was a 24 hr non stop hackathon out of 2260 people only 73 were selected.
My Team name was BullsEye_IIIT and I with my other two team member (Akash) https://github.com/pratap47 and Praney were building a project which build the gap between demand and supply for improving the transportation system of India.
